The first three scripts get run from the root directory of the model of interest (i.e., the directory whose subdirectories are ecf, jobs, sorc, etc.):
   itcheck_1 > /path/to/outputfile_1
   itcheck_2 > /path/to/outputfile_2 # you'll probably want to copy/paste the terminal output of this script into a file
   itcheck_3 > /path/to/outputfile_3

The fourth script gets used inside a test run of a code in ecFlow/LSF; output goes to stdout:
   # in ecf script:
   itcheck_4 --before
   $HOMEmymodel/jobs/JRUNMYMODEL
   itcheck_4 --after
The 'after' part can be run as many times as you like if for example you want to check multiple scripts to see whether they are changing variables locally.

The last script in ./exec runs with one argument that specifies the path to a job output file:
   itcheck_5 /gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/com/output/prod/today/my_model.oXXXXXXXX > /path/to/outputfile_5
